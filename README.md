## Todo

* Tint camera color in spectral plane
* "SPACE: interact" in instructions
* Every 10th cloud is white and pushes you forward
* Add something to collect: PEARLS
    * "A colossal mollusk lobs pearls from the depths! These curiosities shall fetch an ample price."
* Trim silence in thunder mp3
* Design good and bad "encounters" to be used throughout Chapters
    * Good
        * goodies - blunderbuss, weight (slower balloon, less effected by wind)
        * find goodies in derelict balloon, ship, or flotsam
        * commandeer derelict
        * "eye of the storm" - stop clouds for 10 seconds or so.
        * sky opens up and you can play above the dark clouds.
        * specters
    * Bad
        * Whale jumping
        * pirates shooting at you
        * tentacle
        * mountain
* New music - 3/4 time? Accordion / bagpipe / violin - idk

## Issues

* Renderers
    * Phaser.WEBGL
        * blending modes don't work, so lightning doesn't look right
        * still a little too slow for fog filter
    * Phaser.CANVAS - rope alpha very buggy
